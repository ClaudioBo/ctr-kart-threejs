# wheel-billboard-three-js-testing

Small testing project on `Three.js` where I'll try to recreate how [Crash Team Racing (PSX)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crash_Team_Racing) shows their Kart wheel sprites.

I'm also trying out `Three.js` so I can learn ðŸ˜‚

Kart model downloaded from [The Models Resource](https://www.models-resource.com/playstation/crashteamracing/model/61792/), thanks to [CTR-Tools by DCxDemo*](https://github.com/CTR-tools/CTR-tools).  
Wheel sprites ripped by me and uploaded to [The Spriters Resource](https://www.spriters-resource.com/playstation/ctr/sheet/116430/)

## To-do list
- [x] Change sprite depending on camera's view based on horizontal axis  
- [x] Change sprite depending on wheel object rotation  
- [x] Import Crash Kart model  
- [ ] Somehow implement to the rendered how PSX renders their vertex colors   
- [ ] Change sprite depending on camera's view based on vertical axis
