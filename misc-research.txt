// Based on my Bizhawk script
// When drifting, the initial value is 960 and starts to decrease
// This is decreased by 32 each frame (30fps / 1000 = 0.03)

// Value log to be able to perform mini-turbos:
// - less than 448
// - 416
// - 416

// At 480 the smoke now spawns black

// SlideCharge = 416 gave 96 reserves

// Charge at 0 would give approximately 1864 reserves
// Charge at 410 would give approximately 0 reserves
